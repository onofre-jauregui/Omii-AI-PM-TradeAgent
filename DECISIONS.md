## 2026-07-10 — Deferred HITL gate (two-phase) for live trades

**Decision:** HITL gate lives in execute-trade, uses a deferred 202 pattern instead of inline polling.
**Options:**
  A) Inline polling (60s loop inside execute-trade) — rejected: edge function wall-clock timeout makes this unworkable.
  B) Gate in auto-trade, direct execute (skip execute-trade for HITL) — rejected: bypasses the authoritative execution gate; anyone calling execute-trade directly could skip HITL.
  C) Deferred 202 in execute-trade + telegram-webhook fires Phase 2 — chosen.
**Why:** Keeps the gate at the authoritative execution boundary (execute-trade), eliminates timeout risk, and gives telegram-webhook a clean callback path. Phase 2 re-entry via hitlApprovalId is cryptographically scoped to a single pre-authorized approval row.
**Reversibility:** Easy — remove hitlApprovalId check and 202 branch; gate reverts to paper-only execution.
**Trace:** commit f2fd68b on feat/production-hardening

## 2026-07-10 — hitl_approvals table as HITL state store

**Decision:** Supabase `hitl_approvals` table stores pending approvals and serves as the synchronization point between execute-trade (writer) and telegram-webhook (updater).
**Options:** A) Redis pub/sub, B) Supabase table, C) In-memory with webhook callback URL.
**Why:** Already have Supabase as the state store; no new infra; table supports dashboard UI queries; RLS enforces per-user isolation.
**Reversibility:** Easy — table schema is additive; removing the gate doesn't require dropping it.

## 2026-07-10 — Deferred tool-gateway.ts (not yet wired to trading-agent tools)

**Decision:** tool-gateway.ts is created as a shared module but not yet wired into trading-agent's 7+ ungoverned tools. Accepted as a follow-on task.
**Options:** A) Wire all tools now (high effort, lots of surface area), B) Deliver the module, wire incrementally.
**Why:** HITL gate was the P0. The tool gateway pattern is established; wiring is mechanical work that can be done per-tool without architectural decisions. Shipping a half-wired gateway is worse than shipping the module and wiring it properly next.
**Reversibility:** Trivial — additive change, no existing code removed.
**Trace:** commit f2fd68b on feat/production-hardening
