# TradeAgent — Health Check Log

Findings from automated health-check runs. Newest first.

## 2026-07-25 (scheduled health check) — live basket rejected 7x on `insufficient_balance`; no pre-flight balance check existed

**Telegram error state:** 7 `order_failed` / `error` rows, all `insufficient_balance` (Kalshi
400), clustered 16:10–16:20 UTC — 3 legs of one S-001 arb basket (`KXINX-26JUL27H1600-B7412/
B7437/B7462`, buy-NO ~80-83c, 12 contracts/leg) each retried 2-3x across two surface-scanner
cycles before the alert-dedup (`kalshi_order_rejected`, 1h cooldown) went quiet. No occurrences
in the preceding 7 days — this was a fresh, one-off underfunding, not a chronic condition. One
unrelated `authentication_error` (401, `INCORRECT_API_KEY_SIGNATURE`) at 15:15 UTC — single
occurrence, not investigated this pass (no recurrence, likely a transient signing-timestamp skew).

**Root cause:** `execute-trade/index.ts`'s live path (`_shared/kalshi-auth.ts:640-648`) had zero
balance awareness — it submits every order straight to Kalshi and only learns the account can't
cover it from the 400 response. Each leg cost a full wasted round trip, and the resulting
`order_failed` row was indistinguishable from any other rejection reason (rate limit, bad ticker,
auth) until read closely. Verified: `required collateral ≈ (1 - price) × count` per leg ≈ $9.80-9.96
each ≈ $29 for the 3-leg basket, which the account's live balance didn't cover.

**Fix (deployed):** added a pre-flight balance check to `execute-trade/index.ts` — before
submitting a live order, fetch real account balance via `GET /portfolio/balance` (same call
`kalshi-ping` already uses to validate keys) and compare against the order's actual required
collateral (`price × count` for a buy, `(1-price) × count` for a sell/short — the exchange's
standard per-contract margin). If balance is short, skip the Kalshi call entirely, log a distinct
`order_skipped_insufficient_balance` compliance row (not a generic `order_failed`), and fire one
account-level Telegram alert (not one per ticker) naming the exact shortfall. Fails open on a
balance-fetch error — never blocks a trade on a monitoring-path failure. **Verified:** `deno check`
shows zero new type errors vs. baseline (22 pre-existing esm.sh version-mismatch errors, same count
before/after, none in the new code); deployed via `supabase functions deploy execute-trade`. Not yet
observed against a live retry (no basket has re-attempted this specific ticker set since deploy) —
the next live rejection, if any, is the real-world proof; watch for `order_skipped_insufficient_balance`
replacing `order_failed`+400 in `compliance_log`.

**Improvement shipped (this pass):** `health-check/index.ts` had no visibility into real Kalshi
account balance at all — the only way to learn about a funding shortfall was to wait for orders to
start failing. Added a 10th check: fetch live balance for every `kalshi_live` API key and alert
(12h cooldown, dedup'd) if it's under $15 — enough to cover a typical single-leg basket cost. This
turns the exact failure mode above into a proactive warning instead of reactive error-log noise.
Deployed and invoked once post-deploy (`{"ok":true,...}`, no crash); current live balance is above
the $15 floor so no alert fired this run — correct behavior, not yet exercised against a real low-
balance state.

## 2026-07-25 (later run) — reconcile-orders-cron was never actually registered; live orders could rest unreconciled forever

**Telegram error state:** The two bugs from the same-day entry below (RSA-PSS signing,
`time_in_force` constraint) are now confirmed fully resolved with live data, not just
"deployed" — `select mode, status, count(*) from trades where exchange='kalshi' group by
mode, status` shows 32 live orders now reaching `status='open'` cleanly, zero `error`/`critical`
compliance_log rows since 15:20:08 UTC (vs. constant failures before). `time_in_force` values are
correctly `gtc` throughout. This closes the "not yet confirmed against a live order" gap noted in
the entry below.

**New root cause found and fixed (CRITICAL):** All 30+ resting live limit orders showed `0/N
filled` no matter how old (oldest 43 min at check time) — before concluding this was a bug I
invoked `reconcile-orders` directly and it worked fine (`{"checked":30,"unchanged":30,"errors":0}`),
so the *function* wasn't broken. But `select jobname from cron.job` showed **no
`reconcile-orders-cron` job at all** — the function's own doc comment says it's "Invoked by the
reconcile-orders-cron pg_cron job," and a migration (`20260719_realmoney_reconciliation.sql`,
6 days old) exists to create exactly that job plus widen `agent_trades_pending_resolution` to
include live trades. It was never applied: the migration file itself has a syntax bug (`) ON
CONFLICT (jobname) DO UPDATE...` appended to a bare `SELECT cron.schedule(...)`, which Postgres
rejects — `SELECT` doesn't support `ON CONFLICT`. Applying it verbatim reproduced the exact
syntax error, confirming why it silently never landed. Fixed by dropping the invalid clause
(pg_cron 1.6.4's `cron.schedule()` already upserts by jobname) and applying both parts. **Verified
in prod:** job registered (`cron.job` row, active), fired automatically at its first scheduled
tick (`cron.job_run_details` runid 260178, `succeeded`), and `agent_trades_pending_resolution`
now reads `mode = ANY(paper, live)`. Net effect before the fix: every live order that didn't fill
instantly on submission was invisible to auto-settle and would eventually be wrongly zeroed by the
expiration sweep — silent live-trade P&L corruption, not just a cosmetic status field.

**Improvement (deployed):** this bug was invisible to the existing cron watchdog
(`cron_health()`, added 2026-07-06) by construction — it iterates `FROM cron.job`, so a job that
was never registered in the first place can't appear as stale or failed; it only catches jobs
that stop running, not jobs that never started. Added `public.expected_cron_jobs` (manifest table
seeded with all 11 permanent jobs) and rewrote `cron_health()` to `UNION ALL` in a synthetic
`is_stale=true, last_status='missing'` row for any manifest entry absent from `cron.job`. Gave it
its own alert branch in `health-check/index.ts` (`cron_missing`, distinct message from
`cron_stale`) so a future "wrote the migration, forgot to apply it" mistake pages loudly within
the hour instead of hiding for 6 days. **Verified:** `select * from cron_health()` returns all 11
manifest jobs healthy with no false-positive missing rows; redeployed `health-check` and invoked
it once post-deploy — ran clean, no `cron_missing`/`cron_stale`/`cron_failed` alerts.
Reversible: drop the `UNION ALL` branch and the manifest table to revert.

## 2026-07-25 — Live trading was 100% broken since going live: HMAC signing instead of Kalshi's required RSA-PSS, plus a second constraint bug it had been hiding

**Telegram error state:** `failed_trade_queue` showed every live order failing. First cluster
(2026-07-24 22:15–22:50, `deprecated_v1_order_endpoint`, 410) was the old
`/trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders` endpoint Kalshi has retired in favor of
`/trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders`. A same-day in-progress fix (uncommitted on
`fix/live-pilot-instrumentation`) switched the endpoint, which was deployed ~15:03 UTC today —
and immediately every order started failing differently: `authentication_error` /
`INCORRECT_API_KEY_SIGNATURE` (401), 6 in a row. `select mode, status, count(*) from trades
where exchange='kalshi' group by mode, status` showed **60/60 live attempts ever made had
status='failed' — zero successful live trades since real-money trading was enabled
(2026-07-24 21:30).**

**Root cause found and fixed (CRITICAL):** `_shared/kalshi-auth.ts` signed every Kalshi request
with **HMAC-SHA256** over a **second-precision** Unix timestamp. Kalshi's actual scheme (confirmed
against current docs) is **RSA-PSS-SHA256** (salt length = digest length, 32 bytes) over a
**millisecond-precision** timestamp, signing the path only (no query string). This bug is old, not
new — the retired `/portfolio/orders` endpoint was returning its 410 deprecation error *before*
Kalshi ever validated the signature, so the broken auth was invisible until today's endpoint fix
let requests reach real signature validation for the first time. Fixed `generateAuthHeaders` to do
proper RSA-PSS signing (PKCS8 and PKCS1 PEM import, both handled) and switched every caller
(`execute-trade`, `settle-signals`, `reconcile-orders`, `kalshi-proxy`, `market-data-fetcher`) from
`Math.floor(Date.now()/1000)` to `Date.now()`; `kalshi-ping`/`save-kalshi-key` already used ms.
**Verified against the real Kalshi API**, not a mock: minted a session token for the live user and
called `kalshi-ping` (read-only `GET /portfolio/balance`) — first successful authenticated Kalshi
call ever recorded for this account, `{"ok":true,"balance_usd":100}`.

**Second bug, found by the first fix working:** the next real cron cycle got past auth and hit a
new error, `new row for relation "trades" violates check constraint
"trades_time_in_force_check"`. The same uncommitted V2 migration introduced
`kalshiOrderPayload.time_in_force` in Kalshi's V2 vocabulary
(`fill_or_kill`/`good_till_canceled`/`immediate_or_cancel`) and then wrote that same value into our
own `trades.time_in_force` column — but that column's CHECK constraint (and every real caller,
`auto-trade` always sends `"day"`) only accepts the legacy `gtc`/`ioc`/`day` vocabulary. Fixed by
storing a normalized `ledgerTimeInForce` (our own bookkeeping label) instead of the Kalshi-payload
value. **Not yet confirmed against a live order** — deployed, waiting on the next auto-trade-cron
cycle to verify end-to-end.

**Improvement (deployed):** the HMAC bug shipped with zero test coverage because the signing logic
lived in `_shared/kalshi-auth.ts`, which imports `esm.sh` URLs vitest can't resolve — this codebase
already has a "pure logic extracted for testability" convention (`_shared/trading-logic.ts`) that
`kalshi-auth.ts` didn't follow. Extracted the signing logic into a new import-free
`_shared/kalshi-signing.ts` (re-exported from `kalshi-auth.ts` so no call sites changed) and added
`tests/kalshi-signing.test.ts` — 4 tests, RSA-PSS round-trip verified against a generated key pair,
signature byte-length check (256 bytes RSA vs 32-byte HMAC), ms-timestamp check, query-string
stripping. All pass. This is a permanent regression guard: any future accidental reversion to HMAC
or second-precision timestamps now fails CI, not silently in production for months.

**Reversibility:** both fixes are single-function edits, revertible independently. The RSA-PSS
signing change affects every Kalshi-authenticated call (`execute-trade`, `kalshi-ping`,
`reconcile-orders`, `settle-signals`, `kalshi-proxy`, `market-data-fetcher`, `save-kalshi-key`) —
all redeployed and re-verified via `kalshi-ping` after the refactor.

## 2026-07-17 — `fetchWithRetry` retried AbortErrors, silently defeating market-data-fetcher's 8s per-request timeout

**Telegram error state (last 48h):** One new critical since the 07-16 check: `market_data_fetcher_aborted`
at 2026-07-16 22:47 UTC, "run budget exceeded (61.4s)", 1 series failed (`KXHIGHMIA`), 3 skipped
(`KXFED`, `KXGDP`, `KXPAYROLLS`). Self-recovered next cycle (22:51, 18/18, 2.9s) and has stayed
healthy since (18/18, ~2–4s every run through 12:53 today). `trading_silence` fired 07-17 03:10 —
last fill is 2026-07-16 03:05 UTC (~34h ago); strategies are running every 5 min and logging
`no_setup` (filters not met), not erroring, so this reads as market conditions, not a bug. The
07-16-logged `surface-scanner` severity-overload item is still open, unchanged, not re-logged here.

**Root cause found and fixed (HIGH):** `market-data-fetcher/index.ts` wraps each series fetch in
an 8s `AbortController` timeout specifically so "no single request can hang the run" (its own
doc comment, line 32). But `_shared/kalshi-auth.ts:126` `fetchWithRetry` caught the resulting
`AbortError` in its generic `catch` block and retried it like any transient network error —
exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s + jitter) across 3 more attempts against an already-aborted
signal that rejects instantly. Net effect: one stuck/rate-limited series took up to ~16.5s to
fully fail instead of the intended 8s cap, and since `RUN_BUDGET_MS` (50s) is only checked
*between* batches, one bad series in a batch of 5 was enough to blow the budget for the whole
run. This is the same failure class as 07-09 (3×) and 07-13 (full abort, since reduced by
batching but not eliminated) — batching cut the blast radius, this closes the actual hole.

**Fix (deployed):** `fetchWithRetry` now rethrows immediately on `AbortError` instead of
retrying it — cancellation is terminal, not transient. **Verified in prod:** invoked
`market-data-fetcher` once post-deploy → `18/18 series OK, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 3208ms`
(no regression on the happy path; the fix only changes behavior on the abort branch, which
doesn't fire under normal conditions — next 429/timeout event is the real-world proof).
Reversible: single-function revert of the `catch` block in `_shared/kalshi-auth.ts`.

## 2026-07-16 — `compliance_log.severity` overloaded for trading signal, not system health

**Telegram error state (last 48h):** Clean. No `error`/`critical` rows since the 07-13
`market_data_fetcher_aborted` (already resolved 07-14). Zero Telegram alerts fired in the
window. Trading is active (order fills present in `auto_trade_strategy_run`/`order_filled` rows).

**Improvement (logged, MED):** `surface-scanner/index.ts:450` writes `severity: "warning"` to
`compliance_log` on *every* scan that finds an alert with `expected_edge_cents >= 10` — which is
effectively every 5-minute run right now (100% of the last 100 sampled rows were
`surface_scan_complete` warnings). That's a **trading-opportunity flag**, not a system-health
signal, but it shares the same `severity` column the health-check sweep and this exact audit query
by severity. Result: a real `error`/`critical`/`warning` row is needle-in-haystack behind ~288
routine warnings/day. Same root issue as the already-queued `s001_edge_below_fee_hurdle` noise item
in `TASKS.md` — severity is being reused as a business signal. Fix: give surface-scanner its own
`event_type`-based signal (e.g. keep `severity: "info"` always, add `metadata.high_edge: true`) so
`severity` stays reserved for things that actually need a human. Not deployed this run — logging
only, no code/infra change made autonomously.

## 2026-07-14 — market-data-fetcher runs unauthenticated (root cause of Kalshi 503/429 alerts)

**Telegram error state (last 7 days):** No new-class failures. The 07-13 `market_data_fetcher_aborted`
(130.6s run-budget) critical is resolved — fetcher now completes 18/18 series in ~2–3s per cycle
(verified: 10:06 run 3.1s, 18/18, 0 failed). `trading_silence` alerts (07-10, 07-13) were transient —
trading has resumed (last fill 2026-07-14 05:05, `KXINX` filled). Only recurring alerts left are
`api_error_kalshi` 503/429 (07-09, 07-12) — addressed by the improvement below.

**Improvement (logged, HIGH):** Every `market_data_fetch` compliance row still logs
`authenticated: false` — `getKalshiCredentials(supabase, null)` finds no `kalshi_live` row for the
NULL/service tenant and no `KALSHI_API_KEY_ID` / `KALSHI_API_PRIVATE_KEY` env fallback
(`_shared/kalshi-auth.ts:113–114`), so the fetcher hits Kalshi anonymously at the lowest rate tier.
That anonymous tier is the root cause of the recurring 503/429 alerts and the pressure that blew the
old sequential fetcher's budget. Fix: provision a service-level Kalshi key for the fetcher — set
`KALSHI_API_KEY_ID` + `KALSHI_API_PRIVATE_KEY` in the edge-function secrets (or seed a `user_id IS NULL`
`kalshi_live` row) so `authenticated: true`. Expected effect: higher rate ceiling, 503/429 alerts stop,
more headroom under the 50s budget. Reversible (secret-only change, no code).

**RESOLVED — 2026-07-14.** Seeded a service-tenant `api_keys` row (`user_id IS NULL`, provider
`kalshi_live`, id `4306d894…`) reusing the encrypted `key_id`/`secret_ciphertext`/`secret_iv` from
the only stored Kalshi key — Onofre's own (`omiiaiagency@gmail.com`); market-data fetch is read-only,
no trading on the account. No plaintext handled: the fetcher decrypts at runtime via the
`API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` already set on the edge functions. **Verified in prod:** invoked once →
`authenticated: true`, 18/18 series, 0 failed, 805 markets, 2.3s. Rollback: delete row `4306d894…`.

## 2026-07-13 — market-data-fetcher starving on run budget

**Telegram error state (last 7 days):** No new-class failures. The July-6 wave
(`.catch is not a function` in auto-trade strategies + `trade_lessons` check-constraint
violations) is resolved — no recurrences since the 2026-07-10 production-hardening
migration. Remaining alerts are Kalshi upstream 503/429s (transient) and the item below.

**Active issue (critical, today):** `market-data-fetcher` aborted at **130.6s** against a
50s `RUN_BUDGET_MS`, skipping **all 18 series** (KXFED, KXCPI, KXBTC, KXHIGHNY, …). Series
are fetched **strictly sequentially** with per-request retries + `KALSHI_REQUEST_SPACING_MS`
spacing; a few slow/retrying series consume the whole budget, so the budget check trips before
most series are refreshed. Downstream, signal-generator / weather-signal / futures-signal run
on stale market data.

**Improvement (logged to TASKS.md, Queued, HIGH):** Fetch series in **bounded concurrent
batches** (e.g. 4–6 at a time via `Promise.all`) instead of one-at-a-time, and **rotate the
starting series offset each run** so the same tail series aren't perpetually last-in-line and
starved. Expected effect: ~4–6× lower wall-clock, run stays inside the 50s budget, full series
coverage each cycle. Per-request 8s `AbortController` timeout already exists and stays.

**RESOLVED — deployed 2026-07-13.** Rewrote the fetch loop to process series in bounded
concurrent batches (`BATCH_SIZE = 5`, 110ms intra-batch stagger to stay ≤~9 req/sec) with a
rotating per-run start offset. Circuit breaker changed from consecutive-series-failures to
consecutive fully-failed-batches (Kalshi-down signal). Per-request 8s timeout and 50s run budget
retained. **Verified in prod:** invoked once → 18/18 series OK, 844 markets cached, **3.4s**
(was 130.6s abort / 0 series). `compliance_log` `market_data_fetch` row logged `info`, 18/18.

**Follow-up flagged (not blocking):** the verified run logged `authenticated: false` —
`getKalshiCredentials()` returned no Kalshi key, so the fetcher runs unauthenticated (lower rate
limits). It still succeeded, but this is likely what made the old sequential version hit 503s and
blow its budget under load. Worth wiring a service-level Kalshi key for the fetcher.
